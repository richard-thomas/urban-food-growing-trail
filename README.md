# Urban Food Growing Trail
This is a single-page "web app" written in HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript which implements an interactive map for exploring the [Urban Food Growing Trail] (http://ediblebristol.org.uk/urban-food-growing-trail-a-bristol-2015-project/) created by the
[Incredible Edible Bristol] (http://ediblebristol.org.uk/) community food growing movement. As it is targeted at mobile phones with poor network connectivity (as well as for desktop perusal), it uses the compact LeafletJS mapping API (smaller than OpenLayers or GoogleMaps APIs), avoids unnecessary inclusion of libraries (such as jQuery) and features JavaScript "minification" at build time. Although usable before all data (and info pane image thumbnails) have loaded it continues to load all of these asynchronously in the background in order for popups and information panes to render quickly during continued operation. Map tiles at multiple zoom levels must be loaded dynamically (though are cached by the browser). It takes advantage of the responsive design features of the sidebar plugin so that information pane sidebars (desktop) become full screen (mobile). The concatenated and mini-fied webpage (as generated by the included gulpfile 'build') can be viewed here:
