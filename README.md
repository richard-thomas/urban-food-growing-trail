# Urban Food Growing Trail
This is a single-page "web app" which implements an interactive map for exploring the "Urban Food Growing Trail" created
by the "Incredible Edible Bristol" community food growing movement. It was developed both to promote the trail and for the
author to experiment with web development using the Leaflet JavaScript library. The concatenated and mini-fied webpage (as generated by the included gulpfile 'build') can be viewed here:
