This is a difficult bed as it has very limited light and water and we are in the middle of deciding what is best to do with the planting in it. However, at the moment it has a Family Apple Tree, which is one that has been grafted with 2 different varieties, a Blackcurrant bush in reverence to the fact that Ribena was first made in Bristol, and a rhubarb which is currently hiding."

The Engine Shed seemed like the optimum place to put the bed as it’s as low tech as it gets whilst being seriously high tech in the way it uses capillary action to create this amazing bed that only needs watering every 3 weeks of so!!<br><br>In the bed are a variety of crops that are really proving that the capillary action in the bed works! Tomatoes, squashes, fennel, brassicas and sweet marjoram are all looking well and will soon be cropping at which point we will replant with crops that will continue to produce food well into the autumn.<br><br>You will see looking at the bed that we took the design stage a step further than the Food For Free project. Shape Studio (http://shapestudio.co.uk/) did a brilliant job of making the bed not only productive but also beautiful.",
