        "details": "After considerable conversation with Network Rail it was agreed that we could put our first garden on Platform 3 of Temple Meads Station. This is a difficult bed as it has very limited light and water and we are in the middle of deciding what is best to do with the planting in it. However, at the moment it has a Family Apple Tree, which is one that has been grafted with 2 different varieties, a Blackcurrant bush in reverence to the fact that Ribena was first made in Bristol, and a rhubarb which is currently hiding.",

With this in mind, and because our aim is to introduce some more unusual species to Bristol in terms of what we traditionally think we can grow, we introduced a dwarf Nectarine to this bed.<br><br>And so far it is doing well and has some fruit starting to swell!!",

The Engine Shed seemed like the optimum place to put the bed as it’s as low tech as it gets whilst being seriously high tech in the way it uses capillary action to create this amazing bed that only needs watering every 3 weeks of so!!<br><br>In the bed are a variety of crops that are really proving that the capillary action in the bed works! Tomatoes, squashes, fennel, brassicas and sweet marjoram are all looking well and will soon be cropping at which point we will replant with crops that will continue to produce food well into the autumn.<br><br>You will see looking at the bed that we took the design stage a step further than the Food For Free project. Shape Studio (http://shapestudio.co.uk/) did a brilliant job of making the bed not only productive but also beautiful.",

The backbone of the garden are the 2 apple trees, and the perennial fruit and vegetable plants which will remain in place and productive for many years to come. However, it was also necessary to ensure productivity for this year whilst the perennial plants are young and concentrating on putting roots out into the soil rather than cropping so we also added some annual vegetables as well as some edible flowers to fill in the gaps as it were. The edible flowers will self seed and so become a yearly part of the garden too.<br><br>Plants included: 2 Apple Trees, Globe Artichokes, Grapevine Venus, Blackcurrant Titania, Redcurrant Red Lake, Rhubarb Victoria, Rhubarb Timperly Early, Climbing French Bean Blue Lake, Kohl Rabi, Black Kale, Curly Kale, Sweetcorn, Butternut Squash, Calendula, Nasturtium",

Rather than producing a garden that needs huge amounts of maintenance we have put together a garden that is mainly perennial and that has minimal watering needs. In it we have also included a pollinator bed that is full of perennial plants that are bee and pollinator friendly, therefore feeding ourselves but also ensuring plenty of food for the creatures we rely on to pollinate our crops.<br><br>In the bee bed we have the following: Sage, Chives, Verbena bonariensis, Echinops, Perennial Scabious, Perennial Cornflower, Field Poppies, Borage, Veronicastrum<br><br>In the beds for humans are the following: Japanese Quince, Chokeberries, Greengage, Red veined sorrel, Alpine strawberries Rhubarb, Rosemary, Fennel<br><br>We will be adding to these beds throughout the year to create a wonderful, perennial and year round garden which is good for man and beast.",
