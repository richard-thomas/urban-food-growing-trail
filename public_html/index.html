            <p>Incredible Edible Bristol, Bee The Change and Grow Bristol are
                collaborating on an exciting project that is bringing food
                growing to the centre of the city.You will see a trail of food
                growing spaces springing up as you walk from Platform 3 at
                Temple Meads past the council offices at 100 Temple Street and
                along Redcliffe Way to Millennium Square. Its aim is to inspire
                and educate - showing that food growing can be, and is, relevant
                in the urban landscape, as well as to provide free food for
                people and pollinators.</p>

            <p>After considerable conversation with Network Rail it was
                agreed that we could put our first garden on Platform 3 of
                Temple Meads Station. This is a difficult bed as it has very
                limited light and water and we are in the middle of deciding
                what is best to do with the planting in it. However, at the
                moment it has a Family Apple Tree, which is one that has
                been grafted with 2 different varieties, a Blackcurrant bush
                in reverence to the fact that Ribena was first made in
                Bristol, and a rhubarb which is currently hiding.</p>

        <div id="tm-outdoor-beds-info" style="display:none;">
            <p>The raised bed by the Passenger Shed at Temple Meads is one
                that is difficult to manage as it has an immensely sunny
                aspect and so needed planting with a crop that would cope
                with some drought. With this in mind, and because our aim is
                to introduce some more unusual species to Bristol in terms
                of what we traditionally think we can grow, we introduced a
                dwarf Nectarine to this bed.</p>
            <p>And so far it is doing well and has some fruit starting to
                swell!!</p>

                 class="info-photo">
            <p>When James, our strategy team member and maker of
                extraordinary raised beds mentioned the video below, we
                immediately knew we had to make one of these for our Urban
                Growing Trail. The Engine Shed seemed like the optimum
                place to put the bed as it's as low tech as it gets whilst
                being seriously high tech in the way it uses capillary
                action to create this amazing bed that only needs watering
                every 3 weeks of so!!</p>
            <p>In the bed are a variety of
                crops that are really proving that the capillary action in
                the bed works! Tomatoes, squashes, fennel, brassicas and
                sweet marjoram are all looking well and will soon be
                cropping at which point we will replant with crops that will
                continue to produce food well into the autumn.</p>
            <p>You will see looking at the bed that we took the design stage
                a step further than the Food For Free project.
                <a href="http://shapestudio.co.uk/">Shape Studio</a>
                did a brilliant job of making the bed not only productive
                but also beautiful.</p>

            <p>The decisions around what to plant into this garden were
                taken looking making it productive for 2015 as well as
                looking beyond this year and into the future. The backbone
                of the garden are the 2 apple trees, and the perennial
                fruit and vegetable plants which will remain in place and
                productive for many years to come. However, it was also
                necessary to ensure productivity for this year whilst the
                perennial plants are young and concentrating on putting
                roots out into the soil rather than cropping so we also
                added some annual vegetables as well as some edible flowers
                to fill in the gaps as it were. The edible flowers will
                self seed and so become a yearly part of the garden too.</p>
            <p><strong>Plants included:</strong> 2 Apple Trees, Globe
                Artichokes, Grapevine Venus, Blackcurrant Titania, Redcurrant
                Red Lake, Rhubarb Victoria, Rhubarb Timperly Early, Climbing

            <p>The garden outside Thomas Chatterton's Birthplace has been
                designed with permaculture firmly at the forefront of it's
                being. Rather than producing a garden that needs huge
                amounts of maintenance we have put together a garden that is
                mainly perennial and that has minimal watering needs. In it
                we have also included a pollinator bed that is full of
                perennial plants that are bee and pollinator friendly,
                therefore feeding ourselves but also ensuring plenty of food
                for the creatures we rely on to pollinate our crops.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>In the bee bed:</strong> Sage, Chives, Verbena
                    bonariensis, Echinops, Perennial Scabious, Perennial
                    Cornflower, Field Poppies, Borage, Veronicastrum</li>
                <li><strong>In the beds for humans:</strong> Japanese Quince,
                    Chokeberries, Greengage, Red veined sorrel, Alpine
                    strawberries, Rhubarb, Rosemary, Fennel</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will be adding to these beds throughout the year to create
                a wonderful, perennial and year round garden which is good
                for man and beast.</p>

                 class="info-photo">
            <p>All of the trees and shrubs in this garden were chosen by the
                parish committee at St Mary Redcliffe, and we were very
                pleased that they went for the trees that we suggested as
                they are rarely found in the urban landscape and so will
                offer harvests that we do not see often in the city. As you
                will see when you visit the garden, we have bought
                substantially sized trees so that there will be fruit in the
                next couple of years and one of the trees had fruitlets on
                it when planted.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trees:</strong> Medlar, Quince Vranja</li>
                <li><strong>Soft fruit:</strong> 3 Blackcurrants, 3 Gooseberries,
                2 Redcurrants, 1 Whitecurrant.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There will be limited fruit production this year but next
                year everything in the garden will fruit, with the soft
                fruit beginning in late June and July, the Quince in late
                September to October and the Medlar in October and November.

                 class="info-photo">
            <p>The herb bed in Anchor Square was built and planted for the first
                Food Connections Festival in Bristol in 2014. Sponsored by
                Almondsbury Garden Centre, it is a beautiful raised planter
                filled with perennial herbs including lavenders, rosemary,
                thymes, marjoram and three sages, pineapple, blackcurrant and
                traditional. We interplant each year with annual herbs such as
                parsley and coriander.</p>

            <p>When the bed was first installed, during the food Connections
                Festival, we worked with mainly children to plant the bed whilst
                chatting with their parents about what we were doing and who
                Incredible Edible Bristol were. We are shortly going to replant
                some of the herbs to refresh the bed, but its basic make up will
                remain the same.

                 class="info-photo">
            <p>The 5 beds in Millennium Square are themed so that each bed
                tells a story of how space can be efficiently used when it is at
                a premium, to grow maximum crops and show what can be grown in a
                small, urban space. Starting with the bed by the Planetarium,
                the themes are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Soft fruit, herbs and edible flowers/pollinator friendly planting</li>
                <li>Soft fruit - mainly strawberries</li>
                <li>Salads and quick crops along with beans</li>
                <li>Vegetables</li>
                <li>Herbs and late winter crops</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each bed also contains fruit trees that over the years will
                become fully fruiting if small trees. These are all apples and
                pears at the moment but other species will be added over time.
            </p>
            <p>These are by no means set in stone but we hope that by doing
                things this way we can guarantee that something will be growing
                in each bed all year round. This winter we are going to grow
                some green manures in some of the beds overwinter as well, in
                order to continue to work on the soil health in each bed.</p>
            <p>These beds are supported by Almondsbury Garden Centre and
                @Bristol, who own the beds.</p>
