            <p>Incredible Edible Bristol, Bee The Change and Grow Bristol are
                collaborating on an exciting project that is bringing food
                growing to the centre of the city.You will see a trail of food
                growing spaces springing up as you walk from Platform 3 at
                Temple Meads past the council offices at 100 Temple Street and
                along Redcliffe Way to Millennium Square. Its aim is to inspire
                and educate - showing that food growing can be, and is, relevant
                in the urban landscape, as well as to provide free food for
                people and pollinators.</p>

                <p>After considerable conversation with Network Rail it was
                    agreed that we could put our first garden on Platform 3 of
                    Temple Meads Station. This is a difficult bed as it has very
                    limited light and water and we are in the middle of deciding
                    what is best to do with the planting in it. However, at the
                    moment it has a Family Apple Tree, which is one that has
                    been grafted with 2 different varieties, a Blackcurrant bush
                    in reverence to the fact that Ribena was first made in
                    Bristol, and a rhubarb which is currently hiding.</p>

                <p>The raised bed by the Passenger Shed at Temple Meads is one
                    that is difficult to manage as it has an immensely sunny
                    aspect and so needed planting with a crop that would cope
                    with some drought. With this in mind, and because our aim is
                    to introduce some more unusual species to Bristol in terms
                    of what we traditionally think we can grow, we introduced a
                    dwarf Nectarine to this bed.</p>
                <p>And so far it is doing well and has some fruit starting to
                    swell!!</p>

                <p>When James, our strategy team member and maker of
                    extraordinary raised beds mentioned the video below, we
                    immediately knew we had to make one of these for our Urban
                    Growing Trail. The Engine Shed seemed like the optimum
                    place to put the bed as it's as low tech as it gets whilst
                    being seriously high tech in the way it uses capillary
                    action to create this amazing bed that only needs watering
                    every 3 weeks of so!!</p>
                <p>In the bed are a variety of
                    crops that are really proving that the capillary action in
                    the bed works! Tomatoes, squashes, fennel, brassicas and
                    sweet marjoram are all looking well and will soon be
                    cropping at which point we will replant with crops that will
                    continue to produce food well into the autumn.</p>
                <p>You will see looking at the bed that we took the design stage
                    a step further than the Food For Free project.
                    <a href="http://shapestudio.co.uk/">Shape Studio</a>
                    did a brilliant job of making the bed not only productive
                    but also beautiful.</p>

                <p>The decisions around what to plant into this garden were
                    taken looking making it productive for 2015 as well as
                    looking beyond this year and into the future. The backbone
                    of the garden are the 2 apple trees, and the perennial
                    fruit and vegetable plants which will remain in place and
                    productive for many years to come. However, it was also
                    necessary to ensure productivity for this year whilst the
                    perennial plants are young and concentrating on putting
                    roots out into the soil rather than cropping so we also
                    added some annual vegetables as well as some edible flowers
                    to fill in the gaps as it were. The edible flowers will
                    self seed and so become a yearly part of the garden too.</p>
                <p>Plants included: 2 Apple Trees, Globe Artichokes, Grapevine

                <p>The garden outside Thomas Chatterton's Birthplace has been
                    designed with permaculture firmly at the forefront of it's
                    being. Rather than producing a garden that needs huge
                    amounts of maintenance we have put together a garden that is
                    mainly perennial and that has minimal watering needs. In it
                    we have also included a pollinator bed that is full of
                    perennial plants that are bee and pollinator friendly,
                    therefore feeding ourselves but also ensuring plenty of food
                    for the creatures we rely on to pollinate our crops.</p>
                <p>In the bee bed we have the following: Sage, Chives, Verbena
                    bonariensis, Echinops, Perennial Scabious, Perennial
                    Cornflower, Field Poppies, Borage, Veronicastrum</p>
                <p>In the beds for humans are the following: Japanese Quince,
                     Chokeberries, Greengage, Red veined sorrel, Alpine
                    strawberries Rhubarb, Rosemary, Fennel</p>
                <p>We will be adding to these beds throughout the year to create
                    a wonderful, perennial and year round garden which is good
                    for man and beast.</p>

                     alt="Mary Redcliffe beds" height="200">
                <p>All of the trees and shrubs in this garden were chosen by the
                    parish committee at St Mary Redcliffe, and we were very
                    pleased that they went for the trees that we suggested as
                    they are rarely found in the urban landscape and so will
                    offer harvests that we do not see often in the city. As you
                    will see when you visit the garden, we have bought
                    substantially sized trees so that there will be fruit in the
                    next couple of years and one of the trees had fruitlets on
                    it when planted.</p>
                <p>Trees: Medlar, Quince Vranja</p>
                <p>Soft fruit: 3 Blackcurrants, 3 Gooseberries, 2 Redcurrants,
                     1 Whitecurrant.</p>
                <p>There will be limited fruit production this year but next
                    year everything in the garden will fruit, with the soft
                    fruit beginning in late June and July, the Quince in late
                    September to October and the Medlar in October and November.
